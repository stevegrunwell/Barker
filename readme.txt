ABOUT BARKER
============
Barker is a notification system, written on top of the jQuery javascript framework. The ultimate goal of the script is to allow website owners to integrate social media, news stories, and more in (near) real-time into their sites. The script draws heavily from Growl, a system notification system for the Macintosh operating system.

Like Growl, Barker uses non-obtrusive notifications that offer information and reminders to users without interrupting their workflow.


DIRECTION AND GOALS
===================
Eventually, the goal of Barker is to incorporate news, social media content (tweets, etc.), track titles (audio/video playlists), and more into a site. The script could also be useful as a part of callback functions within web applications.


THEMING
=======
The styling for the notifications, including positioning, is determined by the CSS file. This leaves Barker opening to theming everything from icons and colors to position, sizing, and alignment.
